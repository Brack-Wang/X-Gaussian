### Introduction
This is the official implementation of our ECCV 2024 paper "Radiative Gaussian Splatting for Efficient X-ray Novel View Synthesis". Our X-Gaussian is SfM-free. If you find this repo useful, please give it a star ‚≠ê and consider citing our paper. Thank you.

### Coordinate System

The coordinate system in circular cone-beam X-ray scanning follows the OpenCV standards. The transformation between the camera, world, and image coordinate systems is shown below.

## 1. Create Environment:

We recommend using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to set up the environment.

``` sh
# cloning our repo
git clone https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/X-Gaussian --recursive


SET DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1 # Windows only

# install the official environment of 3DGS
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate x_gaussian

# Then put our rasterizer package into the diff-gaussian-rasterization
mv cuda_rasterizer submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization/

# re-install the diff-gaussian-rasterization package
cd submodules
pip install diff-gaussian-rasterization

# back to the main folder
cd ..
```

&nbsp;


## Prepare Dataset
Download our processed datasets from [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SlneuSGkhk0nvwPjxxnpBCO59XhjGGJX?usp=sharing) or [Baidu disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/18zc6jHeNvoUNAF6pUaL9eQ?pwd=cyh2). Then put the downloaded datasets into the folder `data/` as

```sh
  |--data
      # The first five datasets are used in the our paper
      |--chest_50.pickle
      |--abdomen_50.pickle
      |--foot_50.pickle
      |--head_50.pickle
      |--pancreas_50.pickle
      # The rest datasets are from the X3D benchmark
      |--aneurism_50.pickle
      |--backpack_50.pickle
      |--bonsai_50.pickle
      |--box_50.pickle
      |--carp_50.pickle
      |--engine_50.pickle
      |--leg_50.pickle
      |--pelvis_50.pickle
      |--teapot_50.pickle
      |--jaw_50.pickle
```

`Note:` The first five datasets are used to do experiments in our paper. The rest datasets are from [the X3D benchmark](https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/SAX-NeRF/).
